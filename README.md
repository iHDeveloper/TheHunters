# The Hunters (`V0.0`)
A Minecraft mini game has a target and 6 hunters.
The hunters are to kill the target before it reaches the end and kill the ender dragon.

The game is currently in **BETA** state and runs only in `Spigot/Craftbukkit 1.8.8` **only**.

> ⚠️ The game doesn't prevent the players from seeing `The End Credits` ⚠
>
> So I recommend for you to use **PaperSpigot `1.8.8`**
> 
> Also set `disable-end-credits` from the `paper.yml` to `false`

## Getting started
(Installs **Spigot** only not **PaperSpigot** in the server environment)
- Run the server `./gradlew server`

## Compile the game
(Installs **Spigot** only not **PaperSpigot** in the server environment)
- Build the plugin `./gradlew build-plugin`

You will find the plugin in `server/plugins/The Hunters.jar` or `build/The Hunters-0.1.jar`.
