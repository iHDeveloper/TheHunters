# The Hunters
A Minecraft mini game has a target and 6 hunters.
The hunters are to kill the target before it reaches the end and kill the ender dragon.

> ⚠️ The game doesn't prevent the players from seeing `The End Credits` ⚠
>
> So I recommend for you to use **PaperSpigot `1.8.8`**
> 
> Also set `disable-end-credits` from the `paper.yml` to `false`
